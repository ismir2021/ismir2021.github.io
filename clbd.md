title: ISMIR 2021 Call for Late-breaking Demo Contributions
permalink: /clbd/
---

LBD session is a forum for sharing prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community. It is also a great entry point for people who are new to ISMIR to showcase their preliminary work and receive early feedback from fellow researchers. To better support and encourage contributions from people **who are attending ISMIR for the first time**, we are happy to announce a **special opt-in track** in this year's LBD session, which includes a mentoring process that provides constructive feedback to the authors.

Those interested should follow the submission guidelines (see below) and submit extended abstracts through the system. The accepted abstracts must be presented by at least one author as a poster during the LBD session. **Note that the LBD abstract is not a conference paper and will not be part of the official ISMIR 2021 proceedings.**

## Special Opt-in Track: New-to-ISMIR

To support young researchers and newcomers to the MIR community, the LBD session at ISMIR 2021 specifically welcomes contributions by junior researchers or practitioners to demonstrate their work. 

**Mentoring process:** all submissions under this special track will be mentored by volunteers in the ISMIR community, providing the authors with constructive feedback for potential improvements in their camera-ready versions. 

**Financial support:** to qualify for this track, the first author must be a first-time attendee of ISMIR. Participants who satisfy one or more of the following criteria may also be eligible for financial aid:
- An enrolled student during the 2020-2021 academic year and/or the 2021-2022 academic year
- Participants or mentees from the 2020-2021 WiMIR workshop/mentorship program
- Self-identifies as an underrepresented minority (e.g., in terms of gender, sexual orientation, race, country of origin)

## Topics of Interest

The late-breaking/demo session welcomes topics interesting to the MIR community, as specified in the main [call for papers](https://ismir2021.github.io/cfp/), with a special focus on prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results. We aim to provide an inclusive forum that facilitates the discussion of MIR projects in their early stages.

In the New-to-ISMIR special track, we especially welcome submissions from junior researchers who would benefit from the mentoring process. In addition to the topics described above, we encourage the following types of submissions:
- Proof of concepts for new MIR methods
- MIR-focused school projects
- Case-studies involving MIR
