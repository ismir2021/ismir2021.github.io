We are inviting labs to our Lab Showcase, a new ISMIR activity! This call is open to **academic** labs **focusing on MIR research**. To avoid overlap, we accept **no more than one lab from each institution** (but labs are welcome to team up).

## Lab Showcase:

Lab Showcase is an activity introduced this year at ISMIR where every attendant lab will be allocated a virtual booth. We hope this provides an opportunity for lab members to introduce their work to the conference attendees, thus encouraging further communications/collaborations.The virtual booths provide tools for exchanging text messages, making video calls and uploading materials. The booth time is flexible and up to the labs, but we expect a minimum availability of two pre-determined time slots for live chats. What to share in the booths is totally up to the labs.

## Submission Guidelines:

We need the following information in submissions:

1. Lab name, affiliation (institution), and country;  
2. Principle director(s) and contact email(s);  
3. A brief lab introduction (about one paragraph)

Please refer to the [submission form](https://bit.ly/ismir2021labs) or send the above information to us via [email](mailto:ismir2021-labshowcase@ismir.net).
