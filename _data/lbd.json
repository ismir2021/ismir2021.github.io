        "abstract": "Audio production techniques which previously only existed in GUI-constrained digital audio workstations, live-coding environments, or C++ APIs are now accessible with our new Python module called DawDreamer. DawDreamer therefore bridges the gap between real sound engineers and coders imitating them with offline batch-processing. Like contemporary modules in this domain, DawDreamer facilitates the creation of directed acyclic graphs of audio processors which generate or manipulate audio streams. Modules such as RenderMan and Pedalboard can load audio plug-ins in various formats, but DawDreamer can also dynamically compile and execute code from Faust, a powerful signal processing language with many well-tested and optimized functions. Whereas VST and LV2 plug-ins are platform specific, Faust code can be deployed to many platforms and microcontrollers. We discuss DawDreamer's unique features and processors in detail and conclude by introducing potential applications across MIR and generative music tasks including source separation, transcription, parameter inference, and more. We provide fully cross-platform PyPi installers, a Linux Dockerfile, and an example Jupyter notebook.",

However, current disentanglement metrics, such as mutual information gap (MIG), are often inadequate and misleading when used for evaluating latent representations in the presence of interdependent semantic attributes often encountered in real-world music datasets. In this work, we propose a dependency-aware information metric as a drop-in replacement for MIG that accounts for the inherent relationship between semantic attributes.",

Discovering, explaining, and sharing structural patterns through visual representation is still done mostly by hand. This thesis aims to help musicians by providing a tool capable of automatically generating a visualization that contains a clear and comprehensive overview of repetition and change of musical aspects such as harmony, timbre, tempo, and dynamics. Using abstracted audio-content data provided by Spotify, existing structure extraction strategies are combined and expanded upon. Six separate visualization modules are created to accommodate the user in understanding and navigating the music by its structure.",

We are interested in the emergent coherent behavior that arises from the combination of the sounds made by the individual pitches, focusing on the temporal aspect. We consider each pitch activation as an event, and examine the distribution of the interevent times, the time between the deactivation and consecutive activation of the same pitch. The interevent times in a sample of 428 works by four canonical Western composers obey heavy-tailed distributions, and these distributions can be attributed not to the pitch durations themselves but to the order in which pitches are activated. Our results imply that the generative process in music is neither random nor regular, and suggest the presence of hierarchy in pitch activations. We present our initial attempt in creating a hierarchical generative model of music, inspired by the similarities between our findings and Schenkerian analysis.",

In this work a transformer model is designed to generate an accompanying symbolic drum pattern conditioned on an input melody sequence. We propose a data representation scheme for symbolic music, in which silences are also considered and that can be easily scaled to an arbitrary number of instruments, unlike the popular serialized grid. We propose a loss function taking into account the imbalance in the occurrence of the different percussion instruments, and report performance on Lakh Pianoroll dataset set via two musically relevant evaluation metrics.",

In the absence\n of separate bass line tracks, their performances are lim-\n ited to the success of polyphonic transcription algorithms,\n which notoriously perform worse than monophonic tran-\n scription algorithms. In this work, we re-formulate the\n bass line transcription task and design a system that can\n transcribe and reconstruct bass lines for helping with the\n music production process. We use our domain knowledge\n on electronic music and develop a python library for per-\n forming monophonic chorus bass line transcriptions. Tak-\n ing a polyphonic recording, the system can find a beat-\n synchronized chorus section, transcribe its bass line and\n output a bass line reconstruction MIDI file. The tran-\n scribed bass lines are locked tightly to the beat grid with an\n 1/32th (1/128th note in the common time) beat onset reso-\n lution, which can capture rich bass line grooves. Using this\n batch processing integrated python library, we test the per-\n formance on a collection of Tech House music tracks and\n evaluate the outputs by visually inspecting their spectro-\n grams and listening to the bass line MIDI reconstructions.",

Harmony provides context for melody and indicates the tonal framework and progression of a musical passage. One interesting element of music is that harmonic accompaniment is never strictly \"wrong\" or \"right.\" In this work, available at https://github.com/timothydgreer/4_part_harmonizer, we use chord choices and their progressions as proxies for harmonic movement. By using the information contained in a chord at a given moment and an input melody note, this system will output what accompanying chord could be used next in a musical passage. An additional parameter can be tweaked which determines how \"conservative\" the next chord choice would be, providing more possibilities for harmonization. Composers and songwriters can use this tool to brainstorm new harmonic choices, and anyone with an interest in music can find new chord changes to their favorite songs given that they have the melody notes for such a song.

For this demo, we choose a model-based approach that is easy to understand, good for interactions, and well suited for educational purposes. In particular, we present a system for real-time interactive beat tracking based on predominant local pulse (PLP) information, as first described in Grosche et al. In the first section, we show how the PLP-based algorithm can be transformed from an offline procedure to a real-time procedure. In the second section, we present the implementation of a system that uses this real-time procedure as the centerpiece of an interactive beat tracking application.",

While the usage of this tool can vary from artist to artist, and also from performance to performance, a systematic methodology to derive dynamics in terms of musically meaningful terms like piano, forte etc can offer valuable feedback in the context of vocal music education. To this end, we make use of commercial recordings of some popular rock and pop songs from the Smule vocal balanced dataset and transcribe it with dynamic markings with the help of a music teacher.\n Further, we compare the dynamics of the source separated original recordings with the aligned karaoke versions to find the variations in dynamics. We compare and present the differences using statistical analysis, with a goal to provide the dynamic markings as guiding tools for students to learn and adapt with a specific interpretation of a piece of music.",

The approach extends the technique used in DrummerNet, in which a transcription network is fed into a fixed synthesis network and is trained via reconstruction loss. Our initial tests to apply this technique to the problem of guitar transcription performed poorly, so in this work, we focus on improving the transcription part of the previously proposed framework. Here we compare the capabilities and limitations of two different transcription network structures for the task of polyphonic guitar transcription. To verify the plausibility of the network structure in the unsupervised case, we investigate the task in the supervised setting, utilizing the limited labeled guitar data available in the GuitarSet dataset. We find that a 2D CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) operating on input spectrograms is better suited to the guitar transcription task than a U-Net architecture based on 1D convolutions on raw audio. In future work, we will leverage our insights regarding transcription network structure to improve upon our original unsupervised model.",

With an implemented model, we observed the style of music is effectively controlled. It also reduced the amount of music data for music generation from hundreds per style to several.

The notable feature of Panako is that it matches queries even after a speedup, time-stretch or pitch-shift. It is freely available and has no problems indexing and querying 100k sea shanties. The updates presented here improve query performance significantly and allow a wider range of time-stretch, pitch-shift and speed-up factors: e.g. the top 1 true positive rate for 20s query that were sped up by 10 percent increased from 18% to 83% from the 2014 version of Panako to the new version.\n \n The aim of this short writeup is to reintroduce Panako, evaluate the improvements and highlight two techniques with wider applicability. The first of the two techniques is the use of a constant-Q non-stationary Gabor transform: a fast, reversible, fine-grained spectral transform which can be used as a front-end for many MIR tasks. The second is how near-exact hashing is used in combination with a persistent B-Tree to allow some margin of error while maintaining reasonable query speeds.",

For a neural audio synthesizer to be applicable to music creation, meaningful control over the output is essential. This paper provides an overview of an unsupervised approach to deriving useful feature controls learned by a generative model. A system for generation and transformation of drum samples using a style-based generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. The system provides functional control of audio style features, based on principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the intermediate latent space. Additionally, we propose the use of an encoder trained to invert input drums back to the latent space of the pre-trained GAN. We experiment with three modes of control and provide audio results on a supporting website.",

        "abstract": "In the context of Audio Source Separation, one of the main limitations of supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) solutions is the difficulty in designing optimal spectral bases that generalize to any input mix. This lack of generalization has been one of the main reasons why most of the current solutions rely on artificial neural networks (ANN). In this contribution we present a hybrid, transcription-driven template-learning approach that combines the power of ANN with the simplicity and performance of NMF, achieving high-quality, real-time, low interference separation of drums & percussion components. Where in most implementations, NMF-based solutions try to estimate the Activations Matrix (H) given an input mix and a static, manually-defined set of spectral bases (W matrix), here we adapt the transcription output from an ANN to instantiate the H matrix, and have NMF estimate the W matrix instead, resulting in optimal spectral templates that adapt to the input mix. Because the task of transcription is, in general, less complex compared to the task of audio source separation, we still end up with a highly efficient, fast-inference, low-memory footprint pipeline that can run on CPU, making it particularly suitable for client-side implementations as part of creator tools for music production.",

This potential mismatch between prediction confidence and empirical accuracy makes it difficult to account for uncertainties in these models' predictions. Controlling uncertainty is crucial if MIR models' prediction confidences are to be interpreted as probabilities, and doing so can help a model produce more meaningful predictions when faced with ambiguity.\n To properly account for model uncertainties, prediction confidence scores should be calibrated to better reflect the true chance of it being correct.\n We propose a simple and efficient post-hoc probability calibration process using Temperature Scaling.\n We demonstrate the effect of this calibration process on the Rock Corpus for key and chord estimation.",

In this work, we validate a StyleGAN-2 inspired architecture for the unlimited generation of high-quality magnitude spectrogram images, for the purpose of content-based retrieval. In addition, in the same way that it is possible to discover and control specific attributes relevant to the distribution of natural images, we demonstrate that the same is applicable to the domain of audio, showing that when trained on drum loops, some of these controllable latent dimensions directly relate to highly semantic factors such as BPM, rhythmic pattern, low pass and high pass filtering, etc. Even though these generated high-resolution spectrograms can be inverted back into the time-domain and made available for use (we demonstrate this using the Griffin-Lim algorithm), the purpose of this project was to validate the approach with the goal of content-based retrieval.

The current study explores the extent of relationship between lyrics and melodies quantitively in a large dataset of pop songs written in Cantonese, a language with one of the richest tonal systems. To align the lyrics with corresponding melody, the singing voices are extracted from the polyphonic music tracks and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are applied to the singing voices to detect the lyrics content as well as character-wise timestamps. The transcribed lyrics are matched with true lyrics using Levenshtein distance and then further corrected to ensure the lyrics are precisely sung in each melody segment. Finally, the notes of the melody are extracted and compared with frequencies of generated speech to obtain quantitative relationship.",

The potential use cases for reliable lead sheet transcription are broad and include music performance, education, interaction, informatics, and generation. However, the task is challenging because it involves many subtasks: beat tracking, key detection, chord recognition, and melody transcription. A major obstacle is melody transcription which, while arguably simpler for humans than chord recognition, remains a challenging task for MIR. Here we leverage recent advancements in audio pre-training to break new ground on this task, resulting in a system which can reliably detect and transcribe the melody in multitrack recordings. By combining this new melody transcription approach with existing strategies for other subtasks, Sheet Sage can transcribe recordings into score representations which echo the musical understanding of human experts.\n \n Examples: https://chrisdonahue.com/sheetsage-lbd",

To do this we apply DeepDream [1], an algorithm used in the visual domain for exaggerating features which activate specific nodes. We used a model trained on the problem of predominant instrument recognition, which is based on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model described in Han et.al. [2]. From initial results in optimizing test samples towards any target instrument using DeepDream, we find that the instrument models are highly sensitive to small imperceptible perturbations in the input spectrograms which can consistently influence the model to classify a sample towards the target with 100% accuracy. Additionally, when starting with noise we found that DeepDream creates consistent patterns across instrument classes which are visually distinguishable, but still indistinguishable when sonified. Both of these results indicate that learned instrument models are very fragile.",

These audio aspects drive a model face, which is used to warp an arbitrary face real time using piecewise affine warps via GLSL shaders. The system supports animating multiple faces in an image, and audio can be sourced from uploaded files, player recordings from a microphone, or 30 second preview clips from the Spotify API.

        "abstract": "Performance in many Music IR tasks has advanced significantly using deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The fundamental research behind CNNs has primarily been driven by visual domain problems, such as image recognition and object segmentation, and \u201cstandard\u201d CNN architectures are optimized for such visual problems. Our work seeks to leverage these fundamental visual strengths of CNNs by transforming musical structure analysis (MSA) and segmentation into a purely visual task. We use labeled images of self-similarity matrices (SSMs) derived from acoustic features (from popular music examples) as a visual dataset to train a Region Proposal Network (RPN), a state-of-the-art object detection approach, to identify the regions of a song based on visual bounding boxes. This abstract highlights our modifications of the RPN implementation for our SSM dataset, and reports on the fundamental differences between the two tasks that serve as the biggest shortcomings of the approach in its current state.",

        "year": "2021",
        "abstract": "In this work, I introduce a methodology for measuring the similarity between musical pieces by computing a hierarchical representation of their structure from their audio and comparing audio sections that have a similar structural function. Between a pair of musical pieces, the methodology aims to maximize how much of their audio is used to compute their similarity, under the constraint of only comparing structural segments that are deemed related. This introduces musical structure as a relevant characteristic for music similarity metrics, while minimizing the loss of information about the temporal evolution of music features within pieces. Experiments in music similarity measurements within musical genres as well as between studio and live performances are presented.",

The system employs a singing synthesis engine trained on a multilingual choir singing dataset. Digital choral scores are first uploaded in MusicXML format. Then, the system recognizes and renders the different vocal parts. Synchronized audio and digital sheet music are shown on the web interface, which integrates other functionalities for singing practice such as track mixing, or user performance recording and assessment. We will showcase our system, and discuss the main challenges we encountered when processing user-created digital scores in this context.",
