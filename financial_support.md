We aim to keep ISMIR affordable and accessible in order to support Diversity & Inclusion in our community. To this end, ISMIR2021 offers registration waivers and childcare grants.

ISMIR 2021 grant applications are now closed.

## Important dates

We encourage applicants to apply early to maximize their chances of receiving a grant.

- Round 1 / authors: Apply by July 26, 2021.
- Round 2: Apply by September 13, 2021. Applicants are encouraged to apply by this date in order to meet the early-bird registration deadline.

After this, grant applications will be processed on a rolling basis for as long as funding allows.


## Who is eligible

For childcare grants, anyone may apply.

For registration grants, the following funding categories will be prioritized, though anyone may apply:

- **Black in MIR**: Applicants identifying as Black, African, or African-American.
- **Low- or middle-income country**: Applicants whose professional affiliation is based in a country [listed here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vh_VqzPD2e3ybw_VEmcI4kkPZix-rcfIZxwegfpg50A/edit).
- **"New to ISMIR" presenter**: Applicants who will present in the “New to ISMIR” Late-Breaking/Demo submission track.

- **Student**: Applicants enrolled in a degree-granting program in the 2020-2021 and/or 2021-2022 academic year(s).

- **Women in MIR**: Applicants identifying as a woman or other gender minority.

Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need, student status and Diversity & Inclusion eligibility (see above), and availability of funds.
