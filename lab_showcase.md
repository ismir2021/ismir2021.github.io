*Website: [https://www.uma.es/atic/info/126243/infraestructuras/](https://www.uma.es/atic/info/126243/infraestructuras/)*  
*Country: Spain*

The ATIC group of the University of Malaga has a laboratory in which to carry out its research activity with specialized equipment and material. The laboratory is located in the E.T.S.I. Telecommunication of the University of Malaga. 

EEG + NIRS measurement equipment

There are 4 complete systems for the acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, actiCHamp Plus from Brain Products. With these, up to 96 EEG channels can be recorded in 4 people at the same time, simultaneously and synchronized between the 4 subjects and also synchronized with the stimulus or activity of which the brain activity of 4 people is being evaluated. 

The system is modular and configurable, so that, if required, the number of EEG channels can be increased until it is possible to record 160 channels in the appropriate configuration in two people simultaneously or up to 128 channels in three people.

NIRS kits are also available, including:

•	A fixed NIRS measuring device with 32 sources x 32 LED light detectors, compatible with EEG. This system will be expandable to at least 64 sources and 32 detectors.
•	Two portable NIRS measurement equipment. Each NIRS portable measurement equipment must include at least 16 light sources + 16 light detectors and be compatible with EEG measurements. The two computers can be connected to each other, so that they can be used as a single 32x32 system, or as two totally independent systems of at least 16x16.

The EEG caps and electrodes in this system are compatible with the capture of NIRS signals (Near Infrared Spectroscopy), so that, in the same cap, both EEG electrodes and NIRS optodes can be placed that allow the simultaneous use of both techniques on the same subject.

*Country: France*

Algomus (Algorithmic Musicology, [www.algomus.fr](http://www.algomus.fr/)) is a research team in Musical Information Retrieval (MIR) and Computational Music Analysis, focusing on high-level modeling of music scores. We work on analyzing, visualizing, and generating music, for music theorists, musicians, music lovers, and everyone. Collaborating with music theorists, we focus on symbolic scores of tonal music – such as in baroque, classical, romantic, jazz, pop, and dance repertoires. We model patterns, melodies, harmony (chords, chord progressions, cadences), rhythms, texture. We ultimately aim to model music structure. Over the years, the team worked on musical forms such as fugues, variations, and sonata forms. We combine musicological knowledge and computer science methods in text algorithmics, data mining, and machine learning. We are interested in designing explainable algorithmic and AI methods. We are located in France, in the Université de Lille, with strong links to the Université de Picardie Jules-Verne, in Amiens, and the Université de Rouen-Normandie.

## 4. Audio Data Analysis and Signal Processing (ADASP) | Télécom Paris / Institut Polytechnique de Paris

*PI: Slim Essid*  
*Website: [https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr](https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr)*  
*Country: France*

The ADASP group develops data analysis methods primarily targeting audio data. These developments rely on signal processing and machine learning techniques, focusing on:

- data decomposition and representation learning methods, 
- as well as parametric modelling methods.

Such methods are employed essentially to address two types of tasks:

- source separation,
- human activity-related scene and content analysis, notably using classification methods;

with applications in:

- machine listening,
- music information retrieval,
- audio signal transformation (denoising, enhancement, dereverberation, spatialisation),
- heterogeneous, multiview or multimodal data analysis, especially multimedia content analysis,
- physiological signal analysis, especially M/EEG data, dereverberation, spatialisation.

We address fundamental issues such as parsing polyphonic auditory scenes as well as developing novel applications such as human-computer collaborative music making systems. We also combine audio processing with the processing of other modalities including video and symbolic data. On music information retrieval (MIR), we have been working on music transcription, source separation, music alignment, audiovisual analysis of music performances, music generation, and interactive music systems. Beyond MIR, we also work on speech separation, enhancement, diarization, verification, sound event detection and sound retrieval.

## 6. BLACK BOX | German Research Center for AI (DFKI)

We conduct first experiments using devices to measure biophysical signals (e.g EDA, HRV with the EMPATICA wristband) of listeners and asking in parallel for their perceived emotions (e.g Valence Arousal, GEMS, etc.). We aim at providing a dataset for other researchers and using this dataset to explore deep networks for emotion classification tasks. In addition we are interested how this research might affect new generative models for music generation (e.g. VAEs, CANs, etc.) and co-creation opportunities for artists. The team is an interdisciplinary mixture of cognitive scientists, music retrieval and AI experts as well as musicians, composers interested in the usage of AI.

*Country: Canada*

We focus on developing and evaluating practices, frameworks, and tools for the design and construction of worldwide distributed digital music archives and libraries. Over the last few millennia, humans have amassed an enormous amount of information and cultural material that is scattered around the world. It is becoming abundantly clear that the optimal path for acquisition is to distribute the task of digitizing the wealth of historical and cultural heritage material that exists in analogue formats, which may include books, manuscripts, music scores, maps, photographs, videos, analogue tapes, and phonograph records.

In order to achieve this goal, libraries, museums, and archives throughout the world, large or small, need well-researched policies, proper guidance, and efficient tools to digitize their collections and to make them available economically. The research conducted within the program will address unique and imminent challenges posed by the digitization and dissemination of music media.

## 12. Gotham Lab | T.U. Dortmund

*PI: Prof. Mark Gotham*  
*Country: Germany*

On 1.10.2021, I begin a professorship in music theory at T.U. Dortmund. There I will create a new lab for computational approaches to music theory, analysis and composition. At least 1–2 positions are available for a first cohort of lab members at the PhD or Postdoc level immediately.

This new lab joins and complements a wider cluster of activity in MIR at T.U. Dortmund, notably including the simultaneous hiring of another professor (Hauke Egermann) and his creation of a group focussing on music psychology and Technology (the Dortmund Systematic Musicology Lab). Both groups join a long-established, wider network of related scholars in music data analysis (sig-ma.de).
