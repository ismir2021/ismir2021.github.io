## Description of ISMIR 2021 Conference Benefits
 
This Section will be updated regularly, e.g., when the conference platform(s) are decided, or the conference program is announced.
 
**Updates on 31/07/2021**
 
- We are happy to announce that the ISMIR 2021 conference will be hosted on the Clowdr platform!
- The Virtual Booth and Communication Channel benefits are updated to reflect the overlapping features in Clowdr.
- Industry Meetup has been renamed to Sponsor Presentations for clarity. The Sponsor Presentation durations corresponding to each tier are specified.
- Social Event prizes are added as an alternative/addition to promo items, and are available to Sponsors of all tiers.
 
### Logo on the Conference Website
 
Sponsor names and logos will be displayed on the ISMIR 2021 Website in the order of Platinum, Gold, and Silver Tier. The logos will be clickable, and they will redirect to an appropriate URL provided by the Sponsor. The size of the logos for each Tier are:
 
- **Platinum Sponsor:** Large-sized
- **Gold Sponsors:** Medium-sized
- **Silver Sponsors:** Small-sized
 
> See past conferences (e.g., [ISMIR 2019](https://ismir2019.ewi.tudelft.nl/), [ISMIR 2020](https://www.ismir2020.net/)) for a visual reference.
 
### Logo on the Conference Proceedings
 
Sponsor names and logos will be printed at the conference proceedings in the order of Platinum, Gold, and Silver Tier. The size of the logos for each Tier are:
 
- **Platinum Sponsor:** Large-sized
- **Gold Sponsors:** Medium-sized
- **Silver Sponsors:** Small-sized
 
> See [past proceedings](https://www.ismir.net/conferences/) for a visual reference.
 
### Logo on Broadcasts
 
Sponsor names and logos will be broadcast through the video platform of choice during breaks between sessions. Logos will be sized according to Tier, similar to above.
 
### Platform-based Benefits: Virtual Booth and Communication Channel.
 
During the conference, the Sponsor will be provided a medium to promote work conducted in the company, advertise job openings and internship opportunities, and have conversations with conference attendees.
 
This shall be implemented through Clowdr's Sponsor Booths, which has led us to make some changes to the initial call for sponsors.
 
**In the updated call for Sponsors, we have merged the Virtual Booth and Communication Channel benefits due to the way they are tied in Clowdr.** As such, Platinum, Gold, and Silver (if chosen) will receive:
 
- **Virtual Booth:** An online space dedicated to the Sponsor to network with attendees, showcase work, and distribute Promo items. The booth will have the functionalities below:
 - **Chat**: Asynchronous text communication throughout the conference duration
 - **Video**: (Platinum and Gold sponsors only) Video chat functionality throughout the conference, where sponsors can talk with multiple conference participants at a time.
 
Sponsors will be ranked by tier in the exhibition section of the platform. Sponsors of the same tier will be ordered alphabetically.
 
> Silver sponsors, which do not choose the Virtual booth benefit, will not have a chat channel in the company's name. Instead, registered Sponsor personnel can utilize Clowdr's direct messaging features to reach out to conference attendees.
 
 
### Registrations
 
The Sponsor will be able to register their personnel to the Main Conference Event up to the number of registrations defined for their Tier. The number of registrations for each Tier is:
 
- Platinum Sponsor: 5 complimentary registrations
- Gold Sponsor: 2 complimentary registrations
- Silver Sponsor: 1 complimentary registration
 
### Acknowledgments on Social Media
 
Social Media thank you posts to sponsors. For example:
 
> At the confirmation of sponsorship, with an individual post per sponsor.
 
> During the Conference, e.g., Platinum on Day 1, Gold on Day 2, Silver on Day 3 of the Conference.
 
> At the end of the conference, with all sponsors on the same image ordered by Tiers.
 
### Announcements
 
Announcements in social media, ISMIR mailing list, and (if applicable) conference platform. Possible examples:
 
> Social media and mailing list announcements for sponsorship-related activities and job announcements. (Platinum and Gold only)
 
> Sponsor-specific activities featured in the platform as part of "Industry Spotlight" in the daily agenda announcement. (Platinum and Gold Only)
