## Special Session 1: MIR for Human Health and Potential Panel

The MIR for Human Health and Potential Panel brings together researchers from music, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, mathematics, and computer science to continue discussion of a topic which began at ISMIR2014. This topic has become increasingly important, especially during an unprecedented global pandemic which has significant impacts on people’s health, wellbeing and learning, as their interactions with others are restricted due to social distancing measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made music more important as a medium to connect people, to enhance both physical and mental health, and to advance human potential. Social distancing measures have greatly enhanced interest in eHealth and eLearning. Integrating music into digital health/learning technologies helps to make music interventions accessible, scalable, and personalized. Finally, these technological innovations offer effective interventions for health, wellbeing and learning that are safe and non-invasive.

Research at the intersection of neuroscience, medicine, the science of learning, and MIR has the potential to reveal new insights into individual variability and personalized interventions; while mobile systems for collecting physiological data point to promising avenues for ecologically valid studies, and even socially distanced data collection in the home.

**Time:** 3:30-4:30 AM on November 9, 2021 (UTC)

**Moderator:** Ye Wang (National University of Singapore, Singapore)

**Panelists:** Frank Russo (Ryerson University, Canada), Elaine Chew (CNRS – STMS (IRCAM), France), Gus Xia (NYU Shanghai, China), Blair Kaneshiro (Stanford University, USA)

## Special Session 3: Promoting Cultural Diversity in MIR Research

Promoting cultural diversity in MIR research has been recognized by the MIR community as an important task. ISMIR 2021 is proud of having organized a special call-for-papers on cultural diversity, with an outcome of eleven papers accepted. The goal of this session is to reflect on this effort and to discuss how to promote cultural diversity in MIR research in a sustainable manner.

**Time:** 4-5 AM on November 10, 2021 (UTC)

**Moderator:** Scientific Program Co-Chairs

**Panelists:** Magdalena Fuentes (New York University, USA), Xiao Hu (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong), Patrick Savage (Keio University SFC, Japan), Li Su (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)

## Special Session 4: Computational Creativity for Music

This panel on Computational Creativity for Music will begin by discussing definitions of AI, CC, and what panelists perceive as important differences between the two. Portrait XO will reflect on an artist's experience of incorporating algorithms into the creative process – what works, what doesn’t. We will address evaluation, especially work the academics have done to address how we could/should evaluate computational systems and their outputs. Is it sufficient for a machine learning paper to rely solely on metrics such as loss/cross-entropy for evaluation? We will get the panelists' points of view on this, and provide a useful reading list for ISMIR authors aiming to excel at evaluating their creative MIR research.

**Time:** 2:30-3:30 PM on November 10, 2021 (UTC)

**Moderator:** Tom Collins (University of York, UK, Music Artificial Intelligence Algorithms, Inc., USA)

**Panelists:** Anna Jordanous (University of Kent, UK), Dan Ventura (Brigham Young University, USA), Geraint Wiggins (VUB, Belgium / Queen Mary University of London, UK), and Portrait XO (Artist)

## Special Session 5: MIR for Music Education

Computer technology, and MIR in particular, has inspired many innovations in music education, including pitch recognition for singers, score alignment for performance evaluation and AI assistants for student composers. We will discuss the potential of MIR for the future of music education as well as how the needs of music educators can guide MIR research.

**Time:** 4-5 PM on November 10, 2021 (UTC)

**Moderator:** Roger Dannenberg (Carnegie Mellon University, USA)

**Panelists:** Zhiyao Duan (University of Rochester, USA), Anssi Klapuri (Yousician, Finland), Alexander Lerch (Georgia Institute of Technology, USA), Daniel Ray (Muse Group, UK)
